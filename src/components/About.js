      <p> Arappnid is a comprehensive tarantula keeper's web application. Built from the ground up by a fellow hobbyist, Arappnid has everything you need to organise your collection and monitor feeding times, moults, temperatures, humidity levels and more. </p>

      <p>With the tool being in its infancy, I am more than happy to listen to any ideas you would like to see incorporated into Arappnid. You can reach out on our contact page and I will always consider ideas that will further assist you as a keeper and bring a vital ease of life software to the community.</p>
